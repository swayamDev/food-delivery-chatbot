## 📖 About the Project

**Arti** is an AI-powered chatbot developed as part of the **Edunet–Microsoft Foundation Artificial Intelligence Internship**, officially recognized by **AICTE**. This project showcases the use of **Dialogflow** to create an intelligent conversational agent that can answer user queries and be integrated into websites with ease.

This project allowed me to apply what I learned in machine learning, NLP, and generative AI to a practical, real-world use case.
